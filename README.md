# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide Pewlett-Hackard with retirement information for their company so they can plan for a smooth transition when the "silver tsunami" happens. The amount of retirement-eligible employees by title and employees eligible for the mentorship program to train the future of the company were gathered for this project.


## Results
Four major findings from the aforementioned deliverables are as follows:
1. As expected, employees expected to be in retirement age will most always have a higher skillset and be at a higher level of prestige in there careers i.e. being an assistant versus a Senior Engineer. 33% of all retirement eligible employees are Senior Engineers. That's a lot of knowledge leaving the company!
2. Only two employees out of 90,398 retirement eligible employees are Managers. This means there is a lot of talent to choose from that could be promoted to fill those slots.

## Summary
<b>How many roles will need to be filled as the "silver tsunami" begins to make an impact?</b>
<br>
A total of 90,398 employee positions will need to be filled.
<br>
<br>
<b>Are there enough qualified, retirement-ready employees in the departments to mentor the next generation of Pewlett Hackard employees?</b>
<br>
There are a total of 240,124 employees currently working at Pewlett-Hackard. 90,398 of those employees are eligible for retirement and 1,549 are eligible for the mentorship program. That means that 1,549 wil be responsible for mentoring 149,726 employees. Each eligible mentor would have roughly 97 employees to mentor if all remaining employees at the company were to be mentored. It does not appear there are enough qualified, retirement-ready employees to mentor the next generation.
<br>
<br>
<b>Two additional queries that may provide more insidght into the upcoming silver tsunami are:</b>
  1. Total amount of eligible employees for retirement for the next 5 years and respective eligible for the mentorship program during that time
  2. Total budget the company will have to replace retirement employees based off the salaries that will no longer be working for the company once retired.
