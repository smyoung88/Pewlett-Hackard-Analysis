# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis is to provide Pewlett-Hackard with retirement information for their company so they can plan for a smooth transition when the "silver tsunami" happens. The amount of retirement-eligible employees by title and employees eligible for the mentorship program to train the future of the company were gathered for this project.


## Results
Four major findings from the aforementioned deliverables are as follows:
1. As expected, employees expected to be in retirement age will most always have a higher skillset and be at a higher level of prestige in there careers i.e. being an assistant versus a Senior Engineer. 33% of all retirement eligible employees are Senior Engineers. That's a lot of knowledge!
2. Only two employees out of 90,398 retirement eligible employees are Managers. This means there is a lot of talent to choose from that could be promoted to fill those slots.
3. There are 1,549 total employees that are eligible for the mentorship program.
4. The majority of employees eligible to be in the mentorship program are either Senior Engineers (34%) or Senior Staff (37%). The breakdown of employees and their respective titles is shown below:
